<h2>Welcome to Micro Model-View-Controller</h2>
<b>Thank you for trying out MicroMVC</b>

<p>Micro Model-View-Controller (or MicroMVC) is a tiny MVC framework for 
building websites with PHP 5. It offers Model, Library, Controller, Function, 
and View management. Plus other features like URI Routing, hooks/plugins, 
file uploads, database ORM, captcha creation, and more! If you are new 
the Model/View/Controller world of OOP - then this system is for you. 
Every line is documented making it simple to tear-apart and learn from.</p>

<p>MicroMVC is not a replacement for a full MCV framework. Do not plan on
building the next Facebook with it! This system is built for small teams
 that need the power of Object Oriented Design without the "multiple 
 server cost" of large bloated systems. MicroMVC has three goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teach new programers how MVC works with a simple-to-understand code structure.</li>
<li>Show how fast a PHP system can be to encourage other projects to increase performace.</li>
<li>Run small systems (like blogs and article sites) that need MVC without a lot of overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>MicroMVC is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL v3.0</a>
so you can use it for any personal or corporate projects free of charge. 
We believe in open source, so if you see something that is being done 
inefficiently - let us know so we can fix it.</p>
